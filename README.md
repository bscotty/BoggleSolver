~4 Hour Boggle Blitz!
# New Files

## HTML Files

### index.html
* Relatively simple entrypoint for entering a boggle board, with a 4x4 text entry grid. Imperfect and no client side verification of input done. No feedback during the submission/analysis process is far from ideal.

## Javascript Files

### index.js
* All of the javascript logic that gets the analysis done is here. Did my best to provide comments to help facilitate understanding. Spent the vast majority of my time on this.

## CSS Files

### main.css
* Barely worth mentioning, just done to make the visuals more palatable with square inputs and large text. Breaking very little ground here.
